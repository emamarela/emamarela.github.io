# How to Create a Heatmap Using GPX Files from Garmin
Creating a heatmap using GPX files from your Garmin device is an excellent way to visualize your workout data. This blog post will guide you through the process of creating a heatmap using Python. 
--> **GPX** stands for GPS Exchange Format, which is a file format used to store GPS data, such as tracks, waypoints, and routes. GPX files are commonly used by fitness enthusiasts to track their workouts using GPS devices such as Garmin watches. 
--> A heatmap is a graphical representation of data in which the values are represented by colors. In the case of workout data, a heatmap can be used to display where you spent most of your time during your workout. For instance, a red area on the map might indicate that you spent more time in that area during your workout. 
-->To create a heatmap using GPX files from Garmin, you will need to use Python and several libraries such as gpxpy, folium, and gmplot.

Here's a step-by-step explanation :
1. Import necessary libraries:
```python
import os
import fitparse
from gpxpy.gpx import GPX
from fitparse import FitFile
import gpxpy
import gmplot
from folium.plugins import HeatMap
import math
import folium
import pandas as pd
```

2. Define the path to the folder where your GPX files are located:
```python
folder_path = 'C:/Users/emanu/Documents/heatmap/activities'

3. Initialize a list to store the latitude and longitude points from each GPX file:
```python
points = []
```
4. Create a map object using Folium:
```python
m = folium.Map(location=[47.492371, 11.086110], zoom_start=10, zoom_control=True zoom_control_position='topright')
```
This creates a map centered at the given latitude and longitude coordinates with a zoom level of 10 and zoom controls in the top right corner of the map.

5. Iterate through all GPX files in the specified folder and extract the latitude and longitude coordinates from each file:
```python
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if file.endswith(".gpx"):
        with open(os.path.join(folder_path, file), 'r') as f:
            gpx = gpxpy.parse(f)
        
        # Append points to dataframe
        for track in gpx.tracks:
            for segment in track.segments:
                for point in segment.points:
                    points.append([point.latitude, point.longitude])
```
6. Create a list to store the latitude and longitude coordinates for each route:
```python
route_coords = []
```
7. Iterate through each GPX file again and extract the latitude and longitude coordinates for each route:
```python
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if file.endswith(".gpx"):
        with open(os.path.join(folder_path, file), 'r') as f:
            gpx = gpxpy.parse(f)
        
        route_coords = []
        # Append route coordinates to list
        for track in gpx.tracks:
            for segment in track.segments:
                route_coords = [[point.latitude, point.longitude] for point in segment.points]
                folium.PolyLine(route_coords, color='red', weight=2.5, opacity=1).add_to(m)
```
8. Create a Pandas dataframe from the "points" list:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame(points, columns=['latitude', 'longitude'])
```
This code creates a Pandas dataframe from the "points" list with columns labeled "latitude" and "longitude".

9. Create a heatmap using Folium's HeatMap method:
```python
HeatMap(df[['latitude', 'longitude']], name='Heatmap', min_opacity=0.2).add_to(m)
```
10. Add a layer control to the map:
```python
folium.LayerControl().add_to(m)
```
This code adds a layer control to the map that allows the user to toggle the heatmap and route polyline

The heatmap will be saved as an html file. Here's a preview on mine. ![Heatmap Preview](img/heatmap.png)
