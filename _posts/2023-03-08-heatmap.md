description: "Creating a heatmap using GPX files from your Garmin device is an excellent way to visualize your workout data. This blog post will guide you through the process of creating a heatmap using Python. --> **GPX** stands for GPS Exchange Format, which is a file format used to store GPS data, such as tracks, waypoints, and routes. GPX files are commonly used by fitness enthusiasts to track their workouts using GPS devices such as Garmin watches. A heatmap is a graphical representation of data in which the values are represented by colors. In the case of workout data, a heatmap can be used to display where you spent most of your time during your workout. For instance, a red area on the map might indicate that you spent more time in that area during your workout. To create a heatmap using GPX files from Garmin, you will need to use Python and several libraries such as gpxpy, folium, and gmplot."
