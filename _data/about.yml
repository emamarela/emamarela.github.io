    - "Hi, I'm Emanuela Kuhlman"
Welcome to my website! I am a multilingual data scientist with a passion for running, scuba diving, and training for ultra marathons. I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and have gained hands-on experience in contracting enterprise analytics and S/4HANA Cloud Solution Experience during my tenure as an SAP Associate at SAP SE.

With a strong skill set in various fields such as machine learning, data mining, and data visualization, I am proficient in programming with R and Python, including libraries such as Pandas, Pytorch, and Networkx. I also excel in data visualization using Excel and Matplotlib. My diverse experience and fluency in five languages - Albanian, English, German, Italian, and Spanish - bring a fresh perspective to every project I undertake.

When I'm not working on data science projects, you can find me running with my husband, exploring the depths of the ocean through scuba diving, or training for my next ultra marathon. I believe that my unique blend of endurance and problem-solving skills can be applied to any challenge.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to working with you on your data science projects!
